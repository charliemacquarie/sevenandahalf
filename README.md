# Seven And A Half

sevenandahalf is a web app that takes your location and shows you the USGS topographic maps that you are located on. 

It also includes a script to read a .csv file of maps, specify which ones you want using a year cutoff, a US State list, or a bounding box, download the maps, and initialize the app database with that data to allow you to access the maps. 

To run, this app requires an apache2 webserver configured to use the WSGI standard.
